# Min-Height

Utilities for setting the maximum width of an element

## Table of classes

import Table from "../../../src/table/Table";
import elements from "./minHeightElements";

<Table elements={elements} />

## Customization

:::info

To get an introduction on how customization works, it is recommended to visit the [dedicated page in the documentation](/docs/core/customization)

:::

To customize the classes regarding the min-height, you go to modify the fields under the property called `sizing`.

```js [title="wind.config.js"]
import { customize } from "react-native-wind";

customize({
  theme: {
    sizing: {
      container: 140,
    },
  },
});
```

The library will automatically generate classes for height, width, max-height, min-height, max-width and min-width called in this way:

- `w-container`
- `h-container`
- `min-w-container`
- `max-w-container`
- `min-h-container`
- `max-h-container`

Those will have a value of 140

:::note

Adding a property to sizing will always add a class to height, width, max-height, min-height, max-width and min-width because they refer to the same general values
