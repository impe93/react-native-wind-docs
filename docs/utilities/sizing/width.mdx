# Width

Utilities for setting the width of an element

## Table of classes

import Table from "../../../src/table/Table";
import elements from "./widthElements"

<Table elements={elements} />

## Customization

:::info

To get an introduction on how customization works, it is recommended to visit the [dedicated page in the documentation](/docs/core/customization)

:::

To customize the classes regarding the width, you go to modify the fields under the property called `sizing`.

```js [title="wind.config.js"]
import {customize} from 'react-native-wind';

customize({
  theme: {
    sizing: {
      container: 140,
    },
  },
});
```

The library will automatically generate classes for height and width called in this way:

- `w-container`
- `h-container`

Both will have a value of 140

:::note

Adding a property to sizing will always add a class to both height and width because they both refer to the same general values
