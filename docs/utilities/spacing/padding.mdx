# Padding

Utilities for controlling an element's margin.

## Table of classes

import Table from "../../../src/table/Table";
import elements from "./paddingElements"

<Table elements={elements} />

## Customization

:::info

To get an introduction on how customization works, it is recommended to visit the [dedicated page in the documentation](/docs/core/customization)

:::

To customize the classes regarding the padding, you go to modify the fields under the property called `spacing`.

```js [title="wind.config.js"]
import {customize} from 'react-native-wind';

customize({
  theme: {
    spacing: {
      container: 23,
    },
  },
});
```

The library will automatically generate classes for margin and padding called in this way:

- `m-container` (and all other margin classes for every position prefixed like `mt` `mb`...)
- `p-container` (and all other padding classes for every position prefixed like `pt` `pb`...)

All generated classes will have a value of 23

:::note

Adding a property to spacing will always add a class to both margin and padding because they both refer to the same general values
